Engineering Computation Pad - OneNote Template

Installation / Usage:
- Copy `Engineering Computation Pad.one` to `%appdata%\Microsoft\Templates\`
- In the OneNote ribbon, go to `Insert` | `Page Templates` and pick one of the Engineering Computation Pad templates.

Features:
- Engineering computation pad background.
- Header has separate containers for each section.  Middle container is two lines.
  - Since middle header container is higher up, its contents show up in the page list
- Main section paragraph spacing is aligned with grid (0.97 spacing after paragraph).
- Includes three templates: One starts on the first line, one starts on the second line, and one is completely blank (background only - I'd use this for handwritten notes)

Known Issues / To Do:
- Spacing is off for text wrapping (you need to hit enter to start a new paragraph for each line)
- Default container when creating a page is Your Name instead of main content
- Date should be auto-filled when page is created - similar to default OneNote title/header
- "Scale content to paper width" should be checked when printing.  This, in combination with some white text that has been added at the top right corner, prevent prints from being split into multiple pages.  However, pages print with white margins as a result.
